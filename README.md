# EduVenture 🚀

> **A Gamified Learning & School Management Platform**

**EduVenture** is a web-based educational platform designed to bridge the gap between traditional school management and modern student engagement. By integrating gamification mechanics (points, badges, challenges) with robust administrative tools, EduVenture makes learning interactive for students while providing transparency for parents and efficiency for teachers.

## 🧐 About the Project
Traditional learning management systems often focus solely on grades and logistics, leading to lower student engagement. **EduVenture** solves this by creating a unified ecosystem where:
1.  **Students** are motivated by a "mission-based" learning model.
2.  **Parents** have real-time access to their child's academic and behavioral progress.
3.  **Schools** can manage users, classes, and content seamlessly.

This project is developed as part of the **Graduation Project** requirements at **The Hashemite University**.
